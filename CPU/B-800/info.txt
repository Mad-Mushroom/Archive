=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
0000: HALT	->	HLT	->	Stops the CPU and exit the Program
0001: INC	->	INC A B	->	Increases the Register by another Register
0010: DEC	->	DEC A B	->	Decreases the Register by another Register
0011: JMP	->	JMP 5	->	Jumps to a other Part of the Program
0100: CMP	->	CMP A B	->	Checks if the Register is the Value of another Register
0101: JE	->	JE 4	->	Jumps if CMP is succesful
0110: JMPN	->	JMPN 5	->	Jumps if a calculation is negative
0111: SET	->	SET A 2	->	Sets a Register to a specific value
1000: OUTB	->	OUT A	->	Outputs the Registers Value
1001: INB	->	INB A	->	Takes 8-bit Input and stores it in the Register
1010: MEM	->	MEM A 4	->	Write Register to specific Memory Address
1011: LMEM	->	LEM 1 A	->	Load specific Memory Address to an Register
